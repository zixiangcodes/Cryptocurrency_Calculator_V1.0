# Cryptocurrency_Calculator
A simple cryptocurrency calculator to determine how much you will earn after profits. 

My own personal pet project for personal purposes, and to share!
Coded using python via PyCharm ID, and packaged as an .exe using py2exe.

I made it as I started using Luno to earn some extra income via cryptocurrency.
This app is the end result! 

Though its a simple project, I love it so much because its very light-weight and straight-forward to use! 
And it was fun and engaging to build an app from learning programming.

Instructions:
1. Download the files.
2. Put them into a new folder of your choosing.
3. Create a shortcut to "Cryptocurrency_Calculator_V1.0"
4. Use and enjoy!
5. You can copy and paste the information by highlighting the information in the shell and pasting it into a text file for your own reference. 

Notes: 
- Please type in the required input as stated, otherwise the app will crash / have errors.
- I did not added an I/O, as it was originally a proof of concept idea turned workable.

Disclaimer Usage:
- You may freely use my project but you are not allowed to use its code for your own code.
